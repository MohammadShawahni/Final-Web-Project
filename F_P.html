            <h1> Furniture Coordination </h1> <br> <p> When coordinating the furniture, each room must be coordinated separately, and one of the most important
            tips in the coordination process is to choose places that do not conflict with the movement of people inside the room and do not hinder it, and that the sizes of
            the furniture pieces are suitable for the rooms dimensions and the dimensions of its walls and height, as it is not logical to coordinate large-sized furniture 
            within a room Sleeping small, taking into account the ease of access of persons to all parts so that there are no obstacles inside the room,And the arrangement
            of the pieces connected to each other smoothly, and the lighting system must be taken
            into account so that the pieces of furniture do not conflict with the lighting units and to ensure that the light is not blocked and no shadow is formed inside the room. Use in the room
            and adopt it as a center for building the rest of the pieces around it and depending on it. </p> <br> </br>

        <h2> Space Utilization </h2> <br> <p> Perhaps the most prominent thing produced by the development of the furniture industry
        is the production of so-called multi-use furniture, which is pieces of furniture that can be transformed
        in shape and function, that is, the use of one piece of furniture in more than one function, such as using the table as a sofa
        by folding it in a certain way, and these pieces are one of the innovative solutions In the field of furniture manufacturing
        and interior design to the problem of the small space available for the living space, especially in countries that suffer from overcrowding
        and resort to vertical construction that provides few spaces for living. </p>
